The create_message function takes one of the entangled qubits as a input, 
and a message value. The message value is a bit with the value of 0 or 1. 
The message_value is then entangled with the qubit, and converted into 
two classical bits to send the data through classical channels

        by collapsing the state.

The function to receive messages takes the classical encoded
message, along with the second qubit from the Bell pair.
